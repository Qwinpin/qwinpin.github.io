To demonstrate changes in the political views of the state, you can use an animation that will show a smooth transition (color). In this case, it is possible to click on certain states to demonstrate changes for them, the rest either temporarily remove or reduce the opacity.
If you create a two-sided barchart besides the map: deviations to the left are Democrats, right-Republicans, then you can demonstrate these changes directly in the size of bars, which can be more visible than the color code
