1.1
HTML contains static information about the existing document structure
The DOM displays also the data that is generated in the objects of the structure
1.2
This data can be generated both on the client side and on the server side
The data is loaded onto the client's side, after which operations are performed on them, or a request is made to the server that sends the already processed data, which can later be changed on the user's side (sorting, filtering).
2.1
In this case, it is impossible to implement the filtering in the same way as in the filtering by continents, but it is possible to implement the selection of the range gdp, population. With the standard html tools, you can not implement a range-slider, so there remain options for two slider elements or two lists, in which you can select the beginning of the segment and the end.
3.1
Data could be grouped by year, if several time cuts were displayed at once. This would be realized by analogy with the continents. The other way the aggregation by cutoff is numeric: from 0-n, n-n + m, n + m-n + 1m, etc. Implementation of a drop-down list or setting a window width in the form of an input
4.1
The new years property contains objects consisting of properties similar to the previous example, only with the variable value year from 1995 to 2012.
5.1.
SVG provides simplicity of animation, simplifies the scaling of graphic objects
HTML provides easy work with text, full use of CSS
In particular, it is extremely difficult to provide a normal display of textual information in the SVG block, but it is easy to provide an animated change of graphical elements
6.1.
The use of visualization is necessary when demonstrating large amounts of data without applying methods of processing and obtaining numerical conclusions. It is also necessary for demonstrating some processes / data to non-specialists who can't understand raw data.
6.2.
Interactivity allows you to demonstrate the dynamics of any processes.
6.3.
Sometimes it is better to demonstrate a numerical value or some expert conclusion
Visualization gives an understanding of some processes, but not the exact meaning
6.4.
?
6.5.
Position, shape, hue, orientation, texture
6.7
Position, size, lightness, texture
